# Contributing

## Getting Started
 * Fork, then clone the repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/%git.repository.url_id_without_vendor%.git
````

 * Make sure everything goes well:
```bash
composer ci
```

 * Make your changes (Add/Update tests according to your changes).
 * Make sure tests are still green:
```bash
composer cs
composer test
```

 * To check code coverage, launch
```bash
composer coverage
```

 * Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://%git.repository.url%/compare/).
 * Wait for feedback or merge.

  Some stuff that will increase your pull request's acceptance:
    * Write tests.
    * Follow PSR-2 coding style.
    * Write good commit messages.
