{#
As a project include a composer.lock file ci could keep a vendor folder cache
    => composer install will rely on composer.lock and not on vendor folder
As a library should not include a composer.lock, it's not a good idea to cache vendor files
    => composer install will not be done on what you have done (composer update for instance) but on vendor folder
        => You could have unexpected behavior on ci
        => Ci will always rely on lowest versions, while do not caching vendor file will produce the inverse (always using newest version)
